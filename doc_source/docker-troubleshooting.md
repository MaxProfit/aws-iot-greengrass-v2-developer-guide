Use the following information to help troubleshoot issues with running AWS IoT Greengrass in a Docker container\.

### Error: Cannot perform an interactive login from a non TTY device<a name="docker-troubleshootin-ecr-get-login-password"></a>

This error can occur when you run the `aws ecr get-login-password` command\. Make sure that you installed the latest AWS CLI version 2 or version 1\. We recommend that you use the AWS CLI version 2\. For more information, see [Installing the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

### Error: Unknown options: \-no\-include\-email<a name="docker-troubleshooting-cli-version"></a>

This error can occur when you run the `aws ecr get-login` command\. Make sure that you have the latest AWS CLI version installed \(for example, run: `pip install awscli --upgrade --user`\)\. For more information, see [Installing the AWS Command Line Interface on Microsoft Windows](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/awscli-install-windows.html) in the *AWS Command Line Interface User Guide*\.

### Error: A firewall is blocking file Sharing between windows and the containers\.<a name="docker-troubleshooting-firewall"></a>

You might receive this error or a `Firewall Detected` message when running Docker on a Windows computer\. This can also occur if you are signed in on a virtual private network \(VPN\) and your network settings are preventing the shared drive from being mounted\. In that situation, turn off VPN and re\-run the Docker container\.

### Error: An error occurred \(AccessDeniedException\) when calling the GetAuthorizationToken operation: User: arn:aws:iam::*account\-id*:user/<user\-name> is not authorized to perform: ecr:GetAuthorizationToken on resource: \*<a name="docker-troubleshooting-ecr-perms"></a>

You might receive this error when running the `aws ecr get-login-password` command if you don't have sufficient permissions to access an Amazon ECR repository\. For more information, see [Amazon ECR Repository Policy Examples](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/repository-policy-examples.html) and [Accessing One Amazon ECR Repository](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonECR/latest/userguide/security_iam_id-based-policy-examples.html) in the *Amazon ECR User Guide*\.

### Error: You have reached your pull rate limit<a name="docker-troubleshooting-too-many-requests"></a>

Docker Hub limits the number of pull requests that anonymous and Free Docker Hub users can make\. If you exceed the rate limits for anonymous or free user pull requests, then you receive one of the following errors: 

  

```
ERROR: toomanyrequests: Too Many Requests.
```

  

```
You have reached your pull rate limit.
```

To resolve these errors, you can wait for a few hours before you try another pull request\. If you plan on consistently submitting a large number of pull requests, see the [Docker Hub website](https://www.docker.com/increase-rate-limits) for information about rate limits, and options for authenticating and upgrading your Docker account\. 

## Debugging AWS IoT Greengrass in a Docker container<a name="debugging-greengrass-in-docker"></a>

To debug issues with a Docker container, you can persist the Greengrass runtime logs or attach an interactive shell to the Docker container\.

### Persist Greengrass logs outside of the Docker container<a name="debugging-docker-persist-logs"></a>

After you stop a AWS IoT Greengrass container, you can use the following `docker cp ` command to copy the Greengrass logs from the Docker container to a temporary logs directory\. 

```
docker cp container-id:/greengrass/v2/logs /tmp/logs
```

To persist logs even after a container exits or is removed, you must run the AWS IoT Greengrass Docker container after bind\-mounting the `/greengrass/v2/logs` directory\. 

To bind\-mount the `/greengrass/v2/logs` directory, do one of the following when you run a new AWS IoT Greengrass Docker container\.
+ Include `-v /tmp/logs:/greengrass/v2/logs:ro` in your `docker run` command\.

  Modify the `volumes` block in the Compose file to include the following line before you run your `docker-compose up` command\.

  ```
  volumes:
   - /tmp/logs:/greengrass/v2/logs:ro
  ```

You can then check your logs at `/tmp/logs` on your host to see Greengrass logs while AWS IoT Greengrass is running inside the Docker container\.

For information about running Greengrass Docker containers, see [Run AWS IoT Greengrass in Docker with manual provisioning](run-greengrass-docker-manual-provisioning.md) and [Run AWS IoT Greengrass in Docker with automatic provisioning](run-greengrass-docker-automatic-provisioning.md)

### Attach an interactive shell to the Docker container<a name="debugging-docker-attach-shell"></a>

When you use `docker exec` to run commands inside the Docker container, those commands are not captured in the Docker logs\. Logging your commands in the Docker logs can help you investigate the state of the Greengrass Docker container\. Do one of the following:
+ Run the following command in a separate terminal to attach your terminal's standard input, output, and error to the running container\. This enables you to view and control the Docker container from your current terminal\.

  ```
  docker attach container-id
  ```
+ Run the following command in a separate terminal\. This enables you to run your commands in interactive mode, even if the container is not attached\.

  ```
  docker exec -it container-id sh -c "command > /proc/1/fd/1"
  ```
