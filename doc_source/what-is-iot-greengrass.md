# What is AWS IoT Greengrass?<a name="what-is-iot-greengrass"></a>

AWS IoT Greengrass is an open source Internet of Things \(IoT\) edge runtime and cloud service that helps you build, deploy and manage IoT applications on your devices\. You can use AWS IoT Greengrass to build software that enables your devices to act locally on the data that they generate, run predictions based on machine learning models, and filter and aggregate device data\. AWS IoT Greengrass enables your devices to collect and analyze data closer to where that data is generated, react autonomously to local events, and communicate securely with other devices on the local network\. Greengrass devices can also communicate securely with AWS IoT Core and export IoT data to the AWS Cloud\. You can use AWS IoT Greengrass to build edge applications using pre\-built software modules, called components, that can connect your edge devices to AWS services or third\-party services\. You can also use AWS IoT Greengrass to package and run your software using Lambda functions, Docker containers, native operating system processes, or custom runtimes of your choice\. 

The following example shows how an AWS IoT Greengrass device interacts with the AWS Cloud\.
