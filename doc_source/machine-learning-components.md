# Machine learning components<a name="machine-learning-components"></a>

AWS IoT Greengrass provides machine learning components that you can select and deploy to supported devices to [perform machine learning inference](perform-machine-learning-inference.md)\. AWS\-provided machine learning components are broadly categorized as follows:<a name="ml-component-types"></a>
+ **Model component**—Contains machine learning models as Greengrass artifacts\.
+ **Runtime component**—Contains the script that installs the machine learning framework and its dependencies on the Greengrass core device\.
+ **Inference component**—Contains the inference code and includes component dependencies to install the machine learning framework and download pre\-trained machine learning models\.

The public machine learning components use sample inference code and pre\-trained models to perform image classification and object detection using [Deep Learning Runtime](https://github.com/neo-ai/neo-ai-dlr) \(DLR\) and [TensorFlow Lite](https://www.tensorflow.org/lite)\. To perform custom machine learning inference with your own models, or to use a different machine learning framework, you can use the recipes of these public components as templates to create custom machine learning components\. For more information, see [Customize your machine learning components](ml-customization.md)\.
